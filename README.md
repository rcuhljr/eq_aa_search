eq_aa_search
============

Throw away script to parse and display AA's from http://eqaasearch.org/

usage: print_aas.rb Class StartLevel EndLevel

example: >ruby print_aas.rb Shaman 59 60 > Shaman.txt

Will be slow the first time each class is called as it hits the website and builds it's local data stash.
